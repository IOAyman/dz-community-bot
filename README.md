# DZ Community Bot ðŸ¤– 
> A bot for AlgeriaTech.slack.com

The goal of this project is to invite the community to collaborate on building something useful and fun.
The bot should welcome new members of the team and keep the community active in different ways (news, debates, 
job offers, AI-powered interviews/quiz/games ...etc).
But most importantly, keep the atmosphere cool and echo some jokes every now and then as well :)

Our imagination and determination are the only limits to where this can lead :wink:
